# 500 - 1,000

Now that you‚Äôve got 500+ followers, it is time to start building a better sense of belonging with your Audience.


## 1. Start using Twitter Spaces

The first Twitter Spaces I‚Äôve made I was 500+ Followers.

### **What are Spaces?**

Spaces are an audio-only feature that allows you to have conversations with groups of people on Twitter. It‚Äôs like Clubhouse on Twitter.

**Some of the core features:**

- Conversations with groups of people
- Auto-recording your Spaces
- Bring speakers up to the stage
- Target the people you want to join your Spaces:
    - everyone
    - only people you follow, or
    - only people you invite to speak
- 13 people at a time can be speakers
- React with emojis in real-time
- Share tweets within the Spaces to give emphasis on something in particular

üì¢ And why should you use Twitter Spaces?

</aside>

**Because it:**

- allows you to build trust with your audience
- reach your Listeners audiences‚Äô
- allows your audience to engage with you in a better way than just through comments or DMs

**Some examples of Twitter Spaces you can organize:**

1. **Lessons** - eg.: ‚ÄúHow to get to 500+ Followers‚Äù
2. **AMAs** - eg.: ‚Äú0 - 22k followers in 4 months: AMA‚Äù
3. **Chat and chill** - eg.: ‚ÄúCome chat and chill about Twitter and Web3‚Äù

**Here‚Äôs how to schedule a Twitter Spaces:**

## 2. Start finding your Niche

If you want to grow, you got to find your Niche right?

> **What is the major topic you‚Äôll focus your time and effort to create content about?**
> 

Still, while many tend to stress about their Niche, I find it quite difficult to land on your ‚ÄúNiche‚Äù before you start creating content.

And why?

Because at first, you don‚Äôt know yet what you want to create content about or what your Audience likes.

**How to find your Niche:**

- Create content often and consistently - **Quantity drives to Quality**
- Get feedback from your Audience - see what resonates with them
- Use your Analytics to get better insights on what works better
    - look for a high Engagement Rate (5%+)
    - look for a high number of Comments
    - look for a high number of Retweets
    - look for a high number of Profile Visits
- Start creating more content about the topics that got the best Engagement

<aside>
üìå **Your Niche will emerge over time. It is the one and only place you‚Äôll find yourself.**

The intersection between what you love and are passionate about - create content about effortless - and what your audience likes the most - high Engagement Rate.

## 3. Start building your Community

Now that you‚Äôve been creating content consistently, start finding your Niche and interacting with your Audience frequently, it‚Äôs the moment to shift from ‚ÄúAudience Building‚Äù to ‚ÄúCommunity Building‚Äù.

**Key differences between a Community and an Audience:**

- Community - like-minded people with the same core values and common goals
- Audience - people that follow you despite the values or shared goals

**Why build a Community?**

Becoming a successful Creator is a hard and long-term journey. You can do it all by yourself still, it makes it harder.

<aside>
ü•∞ Having a community of like-minded people will help you during your journey because you‚Äôll work as a Team, helping each other along the way, and making it more fun.

I‚Äôll bring more content overtime on **Building a Community.**
