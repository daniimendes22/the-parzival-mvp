## Name

The first step is to choose the ** Name ** you want people to know you for.

- Make sure it‚Äôs easy to pronounce according to the Audience you‚Äôre targeting.
- Here's an example:

üí° **Eg.:** *Bernardo --> **Bernie***

</aside>

- **Bernie** is the **Name** I use because it is easier to spell than Bernardo. Still, I keep using my real name both on my personal website and other assets.
- Your **Name** is the foundation of your Personal Brand, make it as ambitious as your ambition.
- You can also use an ‚Äúaka‚Äù to represent the name you don‚Äôt bother for people to treat you for.

üí° **Eg.:** *Bernardo Faro (aka Bernie)*
