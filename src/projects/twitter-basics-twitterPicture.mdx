## Profile Picture

Now that youâ€™ve decided the Name you want to use and the Twitter Handle you want people to recognize you for, itâ€™s time to give a Face to your Profile.

- In this case, you can go 2 ways:
    1. Use a Picture that represents you (like your Face)
    2. Use a Picture that doesnâ€™t represent you (like an NFT Profile Picture, a pseudo-anonymous representation of your page, etc)
- Assuming youâ€™re going with the **1.** Iâ€™d suggest to:
    - use a clean picture
    - remove the background
    - compel a professional or personal look according to the type of Audience you targeting
