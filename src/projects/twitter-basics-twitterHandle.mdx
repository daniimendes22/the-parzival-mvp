## Twitter Handle

Now that you’ve chosen your Name, it’s time to find a good **Twitter Handle** that represents you.

- This is very important because, as you start growing, more people will Mention you in their Tweets.
- Try some iterations with your name like:
    - bernardofaro
    - bernardo_aka_bernie
    - I_am_bernie
    - here_bernie
    - the_bernie
    - thebernie
    - real_bernie
    - hey_bernie
- In my case, I’ve chosen the latest:

<aside>
💡 **@hey_bernie**

</aside>

- I believe these are some of the best combinations because they:
    1. represent the Person (Me/You)
    2. make it easy to write and tag
    3. are more “professional”
