# 0 - 100

# Previous steps

## 1. Create Value

When it comes to creating content on Twitter, the first step is to learn how to create proper value.

**Examples of how to create value:**

- Build-in public
- Reach goals in public
- Document your journey
- Share advise to your past-self
- Curate the best resources in your niche
- Share what you learn while you’re learning

💡 **Helping people figure out things is the best way to create value.**

## 2. Tweet Daily

Now that you know how to create value, it is the moment to start posting.

If you want to see results, you have to post daily. At the start, I used to publish 3-5 Tweets a day from my account.

💡 **But remember: it has to bring value. Better not tweeting anything if you don't have anything to say.**

## 3. Be Consistent

People and Twitter's algorithm love consistency, be sure to post at least once per day.

That being said, if you want to see results you got to show up every day, no matter what.

Set up alarms, build the proper systems, but show up every day at least once.

## 4. Engage Genuinely

Twitter is a **Social** Media platform which means that being Social is what its algorithm expects first.

**Engage with 1-2 people on a daily basis:**

- Comment on their Tweets
- Quote tweeting their tweets
- DMing them about topics they like

Engaging isn’t jumping into someone’s Tweets and saying:

- “Thanks” or
- “That’s 🔥 brooo”

**Instead:**

- Expand on what they’ve tweeted
- Give your opinion on what they’re tweeting about

💡 This is the worst way to engage with someone. **Never forget, create value!**
