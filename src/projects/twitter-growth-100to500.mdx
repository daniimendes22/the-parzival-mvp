# 100 - 500

## 1. Turn on Notifications on bigger accounts

If you want to start building your name the best way to do it is by turning on Notifications under big accounts.

**Why?**

Because the moment they Tweet something, those tweets will show up on your Timeline.

After that all you have to do is: **reply to their tweets asap.**

Still, the way you should do it is, once again, by providing value and this is the tricky thing about engaging with bigger accounts.

It’s really hard to create value other than just shitposting like “thank you” of “wow, great list”.

I you want to create value as I’ve written before, write something insightful.

**Why?**

Because trust me, they’ll notice your comment and perhaps reply to you, giving you a ton of visibility immediately which will grab other people’s attention.

## 2. Start writing threads

If you have been writing consistently over a couple of days you’ll start noticing people interacting with your Tweets.

Give those people some space to breathe and then that’s the moment when you must start writing threads.

And what’s a Twitter thread?

A Twitter thread is a number of Tweets under the same Tweet.

And why doing those?

Because while Single Tweets are good to educate the algorithm and help people you’re real and willing to put in the work to deliver value, **Threads are the best way for you to expand on your initial thoughts and build better relations.**

> Here’s an example of a Twitter thread:

## 3. Start using DMs

People don’t get how many bad DMs I get. 

**Something like:**

- “👋”
- "hey"
- "Hello Bernie"
- "Hello. How to grow my audience on twitter?"

The secret here is to provide value first or sharing something you know the other person will value and only ask what you want after.

Start a conversation first and go with the ask second. **Still remember, you can just try to build a friendship ok?! You don’t have to always ask something.**
